prompt = """In a task named Drug-Disease Matching. Identify potential diseases that could be treated by a [specific Drug]. 
Now I give you the name of a drug and you respond by giving some diseases that the drug can treat or relieve. Then give brief explanations.
For each drug, provide an analysis of its target genes and pathways and explain their relevance to the disease mechanism in the explanation.
