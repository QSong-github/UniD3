prompt = """In a task named Drug-Target Analysis (Map the genes and pathways targeted by [specific drug]). 
Now I give you a drug name, and you give a pair of questions and answers about this drug in the current task.
The questions and answers need to include how these targets relate to [specific disease] and evaluate whether the drug's mechanism of action is consistent with the underlying biology of the disease.
To keep it simple, please make sure your response contains only two parts: Question and Answer.

Here is an example:
The drug name is OMADACYCLINE

Question: How effective is Omadacycline for treating acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI)?
Answer: Omadacycline is highly effective for treating ABSSSI. Clinical trials (OASIS-1 and OASIS-2) demonstrated its efficacy, showing similar success rates to linezolid in both early clinical response and overall outcomes. It interacts strongly with bacterial ribosomal subunits to inhibit protein synthesis, and is effective against drug-resistant bacteria like MRSA. Omadacycline has a comparable safety profile to linezolid, with common side effects being mild gastrointestinal issues.

Now, please answer the following question:
The drug name is """
